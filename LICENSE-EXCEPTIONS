This software must not be used with a service which currently hosts the game
which goes by or had once gone by the name of "Collective Unconscious."

The following definitions can be updated by the current maintainer without 
being considered changes to this license:
    UPSTREAM: https://github.com/AcrylonitrileButadieneStyrene/pengui-ball
    PRIMARY: master
End of definitions.

This exclusion may be revoked at any time by the current maintainer of the
UPSTREAM repository. In the event that this exclusion is revoked, the software
is relicensed under the more permissive MIT OR Apache-2.0 set of licenses. 
The maintainer can manually initate a revocation by updating the README file and
removing the LICENSE-EXCEPTIONS file. If the PRIMARY branch of the upstream goes
for more than 3 years without any commits at any point in time, this exclusion 
is automatically revoked without changes to the license files being necessary.
